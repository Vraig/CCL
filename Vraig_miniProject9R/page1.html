<p>[Verse 1] </p>
<p>First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil</p>
<p>For real</p>
<p>You the only father that I ever knew</p>
<p>I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you</p>
<p>Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville</p>
<p>Fulfilled</p>
<p>Listen, even back when we was poke, my team ill</p>
<p>Martin Luther King would'a been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga</p><br>

<p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
<p>One time for my L.A. sisters</p>
<p>One time for my L.A. hoes</p>
<p>Lame niggas can't tell the difference</p>
<p>One time for a nigga who know</p><br>

<p>[Chorus 1]</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p><br>

<br><p>[Verse 2]</p>
No role models and I'm here right now
<p>No role models to speak of</p>
<p>Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one</p>
<p>Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch</p>
<p>Not Trina but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up</p>
<p>And tell her, "Hey, what's good?</p>
<p>Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good"</p>
<p>Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood</p>
<p>I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods</p>
<p>Ain't got no shame 'bout it</p>
<p>She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch</p>
<p>I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it"</p>
<p>But then I thought back, back to a better me</p>
<p>Before I was a B-list celepity</p>
<p>'Fore I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily</p>
<p>Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me</p><br>


<br><p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
<p>One time for my L.A. sisters</p>
<p>One time for my L.A. hoes</p>
<p>Lame niggas can't tell the difference</p>
<p>One time for a nigga who know</p><br>

<br><p>[Chorus 1]</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p><br>

<br><p>[Verse 3]</p>
<p>I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love</p>
<p>That Jada and that Will love</p>
<p>That leave a toothpush at your crib love</p>
<p>And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love</p>
<p>Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows</p>
<p>Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes</p>
<p>Out in Hollywood pingin' back five or six hoes</p>
<p>Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go</p>
<p>She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap</p>
<p>You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?</p>
<p>Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave</p>
<p>"I'ma need my shirt back" (Nigga, you know how it go)</p><br>


<br><p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
<p>One time for my L.A. sisters</p>
<p>One time for my L.A. hoes</p>
<p>Lame niggas can't tell the difference</p>
<p>One time for a nigga who know</p><br>

<br><p>[Chorus 1]</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p><br>

<br><p>[Interlude: George W. Bush]</p>
<p>There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says,</p>
<p> fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me—can't get fooled again.</p><br>

<br><p>[bridge]</p>
<p>Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)</p>
<p>Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)</p>
<p>Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign</p>
<p>Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop bop bop)</p>
<p>Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)</p>
<p>Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)</p>
<p>Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign</p>
<p>Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop bop bop)</p><br>

<br><p>[Verse 4]</p>
<p>My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet</p>
<p>My only regret was too young for Nia Long</p>
<p>Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows</p>
<p>Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along</p>
<p>My only regret was too young for Sade Adu</p>
<p>My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home</p>
<p>Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone</p>
<p>With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song</p><br>


<br><p>[Chorus 2]</p>
<p>She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow</p>
<p>She shallow</p>
<p>She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow (Yeah, ayy)</p>
<p>She shallow</p>
<p>She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow</p>
<p>She shallow</p>
<p>She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow</p>
<p>She shallow</p><br>

<br><p>[Chorus 1]</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p>
<p>Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved</p><br>
